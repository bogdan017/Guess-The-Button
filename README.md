# Guess-The-Button

&emsp;&emsp;This project is a simple game in which we have three buttons and we can choose only one that can be the winner. The player chooses the desired button and a message will be displayed after the button is pressed.

&emsp;&emsp;We can also generalize this game using an input that can generate as many buttons as the player wants and it will apply the same process as expalined above
